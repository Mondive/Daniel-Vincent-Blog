    <h1>Operation Shut Eyes: Who is he?</h1>
   
     <p>It starts off with me pomped up to read. I pick up a textbook and my jotting note and I start reading.</p>
     <p>After some time, I feel tired and decide to take a break and shortly after that, I'm back reading.</p>
     <p>This goes on for a while, read, take a break and back to reading again. And like a silent cobra, he begins his operation.</p>
     <p>He started by making me feel hungry and of course I did what anyone would have done and got something to eat.</p>
     <p>Then he begins phase <u>two</u>...</p>
     <p>After having something to eat, I return back to my reading and ever so subtly he deceives me to check my phone.</p>
     <p>Not noticing his intentions, I decide to oblige saying to my self, 'well, whats the worst that could happen?'.</p>
     <p>Eventually I discover that sitting up and scrolling on my phone wasn't comfortable. So I made my way to my bed and at first I start with a sitting position, then a partial lying position and finally the inescapable lying position.</p>
     <p>I made the mistake of turning to my side and then it happened. Stage three of his operation. Melatonin kicks in and I start to feel weak and eventually, I was drowned in a world of absolute calmness and I drifted off into a state of total harmony and peace.</p>
     <p>Ring!! Ring!!! went my alarm, I had woken up into a New day.</p>
     <p>I brushed my teeth, dressed up and went to take my books from my desk. And it dawned on me... I hadn't read all the topics for that days test.</p>
     <p>Hurriedly, I began to skim through pages like a desperate man hoping to find some small cash in his Bible the only difference was that I was hoping to quickly grasp some concepts before leaving.</p>
     <p>I arrived at all school and we had our test. A few day's later, the test is results where out. And me and 'him' saw our score.</p>
     <p>Sixty out of a hundred, not bad. But it would have been much more better if 'he' hadn't disturbed my reading.</p>
